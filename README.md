# Linear Regression Progression
This repository is designed to document and track my progress as I work with Linear Regression models. The goal is to store the evolution of my approach, from basic implementations to more advanced techniques, with a focus on parameter tuning, model evaluation, and real-world applications.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a journal for:

Tracking my personal development and understanding of linear regression.
Saving and reviewing code that demonstrates the incremental improvements and challenges faced during the learning process.
Providing a reference point for future projects that involve regression tasks.

## Key Features
Linear Regression Models: The repository includes various implementations of linear regression, from simple models to more complex ones that incorporate feature selection, regularization techniques, and model diagnostics.

### Model Evaluation:
Focus on key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared to assess model performance and generalization to unseen data.

### Learning Progression:
The files document the learning process, highlighting challenges, improvements, and key insights gained during experimentation with different datasets.

## Technologies Used
Python: Used to implement linear regression models.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the regression models.
Pandas & NumPy: For dataset manipulation and feature engineering.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: To visualize the regression results and residual plots.
## Future Directions
This repository will continue to evolve as I explore more advanced topics, such as regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso), polynomial regression, and handling multicollinearity. It will also include case studies from real-world datasets to demonstrate the practical applications of linear regression.
